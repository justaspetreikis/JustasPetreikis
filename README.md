### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ As a highly experienced Department Manager with almost 10 years of hands-on experience in warehouse operations, I have developed a strong understanding of logistics and supply chain management. I have consistently demonstrated my ability to lead teams and manage complex processes, ensuring efficient and effective operations across all areas of the warehouse.

ðŸ˜„In my most recent role as Department Manager for Goods Receiving, I was responsible for overseeing the inbound flow of goods, managing inventory levels, and ensuring timely and accurate deliveries to internal and external stakeholders. Through effective communication and collaboration with cross-functional teams, I was able to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs, while maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction.

ðŸŒ±In addition to my extensive experience in warehouse operations, I have recently completed a .NET programming course where I gained hands-on experience with C#, Entity Framework, Microservices, REST APIs, .NET Core, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and MySQL. I am now eager to begin my journey as a .NET Junior Programmer, leveraging my expertise in logistics and my newly acquired technical skills to contribute to a dynamic team.

ðŸ‘¯As a highly motivated and dedicated professional, I am committed to continuous learning and professional development. I am excited about the prospect of joining a dynamic team where I can continue to grow my skills and make a meaningful contribution to the organization.
